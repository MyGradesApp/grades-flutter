# SwiftGrade

SwiftGrade is a mobile application that allows students to check their school assignment scores. We aim to support over 180 schools in the School District of Palm Beach County. We are doing this as an accommodation for students. We are not storing or collecting their information. We have made security and safety of their information a priority for this application - SwiftGrade does not use an external server accessible by us and all requests are fully encrypted. In addition, we are not pulling personal information such as name, email, or address.
At its basic level, SwiftGrade works by logging in to the district portal with the same authentication a student would normally use to access their grades. It then scans their grades, pulls them back to their device, and displays them in a more convenient and user-friendly fashion. The app is separated into several pages. After logging in, the user sees a screen with their classes and class averages. If they click on a class, it expands into a full page with specific assignment grades. They can also see a profile screen that displays class rank and GPA.
This app exists because it fills a need - there is currently no "grades" app in our school district, and the website is slow and not at all user-friendly.
